## Inspiration

A half-finished carton of forgotten Oatly Oat Milk in one of our group member’s refrigerator one morning which was accompanied with a rancid odour reflects one of the common issues households face when it comes to food management.
Discarding food due to the lack of keeping track of the amount of food bought and their expiry dates is a bigger problem than it seems - it accounts for more than half of Singapore households’ ‘avoidable’ food waste and about $342 million of food wasted by households every year. As such, we decided to create an app that would tackle this issue to reduce the amount of unnecessary food wasted by households.

## What it does

The BestBy application makes use of a BestBy Telegram bot, which scans receipts to obtain the list of food items purchased in order to determine their Best By dates through Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This information will be incorporated into our application to send reminders to users when their food items are expiring, so as to minimise food wastage. In addition, BestBy educates users on the ideal food storage methods and recipes that make use of leftover food, as well as provide a community feature for users to give away excess food that are reaching their Best By dates. Therefore, this reduces the amount of unnecessary food waste produced by households and individuals.
